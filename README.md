-------

This project is a simplified recreation of the
[_Gwent_](https://www.playgwent.com/en) card game developed by [_CD PROJEKT RED_](https://cdprojektred.com/en/).

## Brief explaination of the game

The game consists of two players, where each one has a deck and a hand of cards they can play on a board. The game is split into rounds and the winner is decided in a best-of-three match.

There's 4 different types of cards that have various kinds of effects on the rest of the cards on the field.

The board is split into two sections, one for each player. Each player's section is also sub-divided into three sections for each type of card. The board also includes a special section for weather cards (cards that have effects over the whole board).

## Project's goal

The main goal of the project is to implement all of the features from the game making a correct use of dessign patterns such as Visitor Pattern, Observer Pattern, State Pattern, etc., as well as correctly following the Object-oriented programming paradigm. The code must also be fully tested and well documented.

Here is a PDF file containing the [full instructions](Enunciado_Proyecto_V1.0.2.pdf) given for the project (in spanish).
